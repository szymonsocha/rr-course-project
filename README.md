# Reproducible Research Final Project
This repository constitutes a final project for the course *Reproducible Research*. The main objective of the project was to transcribe a Python [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anshigupta01/flight-price-prediction/notebook?fbclid=IwAR2vtpE8xwc7nhPqDwdEiwwImw62_XuIxTgEkG0Qo2OCCyHIONRIv7DD3pM) into R, which was downloaded from the Kaggle platform. The code readability was improved, and the analysis was expanded by incorporating additional machine learning models. The results are presented in the form of an RMarkdown report. To ensure the reproducibility of our work, we utilize the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package, saving the versions of dependencies used in the [`renv.lock`](/renv.lock) file.
